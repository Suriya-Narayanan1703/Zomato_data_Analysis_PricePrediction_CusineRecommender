# Zomato_data_CusineRecommender_from_Analysis

Welcome to the Zomota Cuisine Recommender project repository! This project aims to build a smart cuisine recommendation system using machine learning and collaborative filtering techniques. The system is designed to suggest various cuisines to users based on their preferences, previous orders, and similar users' preferences. This README file will guide you through the project and provide instructions on how to set up and use the recommender system.

1. Project Overview

The Zomota Cuisine Recommender project is an intelligent system that takes into account users' historical order data and provides personalized cuisine recommendations. The main components of the project include data collection, preprocessing, collaborative filtering algorithm, and a user interface for interacting with the recommendation system.

2. Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:


Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Flask (for the user interface) here we use streamlit you can contribute by flask also!!
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring data and models)
You can install the Python dependencies using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask
3. Data Collection and Preprocessing

The data used for training and testing the cuisine recommender system should be in a structured format. Typically, this data includes information about users, their historical orders, and corresponding cuisines.

Ensure that you have the necessary data files in the correct format. You might need to preprocess the data to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and convert it into a suitable format for model training.

4. Collaborative Filtering Algorithm

The heart of the cuisine recommender system lies in the collaborative filtering algorithm. This algorithm analyzes user preferences and identifies similarities between users to make recommendations. The code for the collaborative filtering algorithm can be found in the collaborative_filtering.py file. You can customize the algorithm and its parameters as needed.

5. User Interface

To provide a user-friendly experience, this project includes a web-based user interface using Flask. The user interface allows users to input their preferences, and the system responds with cuisine recommendations. The Flask application can be found in the app.py file.

Use streamlin run in the commmand prompt directory to run your file
